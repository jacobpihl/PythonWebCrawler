# Web Crawler
Web Crawler with graphing capabilities written in Python.


## How to use
Create a .txt file called "queue.txt" and add the websites you want to crawl to it. One website per line, including "http://" at the front is preferred.
Run "webcrawler.py" and wait. The graph will pop up when the program is done crawling. A tree structure of the website will be provided in a text file named *website_name.txt*.
